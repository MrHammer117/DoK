This game will be a top down game similar to the likes of COD zombies with RPG like upgrades, and
perhaps 3 classes: Thrown melee, Magic, and Shotgun.

The game is set within the underground of the Dwarf Hold of Kholdor, there is a (insert monster) 
incursion that you have been sent down to clear out, however you've been trapped and have to defend
yourself from an ungodly onslaught of enemies.
